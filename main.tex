Overleaf is a collaborative LaTeX editor that simplifies writing and sharing scientific documents. By integrating Overleaf with GitHub, users can efficiently version control their LaTeX projects and collaborate seamlessly. This setup allows you to push changes from Overleaf to GitHub and pull updates from GitHub back into Overleaf. It ensures that document revisions are tracked, reducing the risk of errors in collaborative environments. Follow this guide to learn how to connect Overleaf with GitHub and manage your LaTeX documents effectively.

Overleaf est un éditeur collaboratif LaTeX qui simplifie la rédaction et le partage de documents scientifiques. En intégrant Overleaf avec GitHub, les utilisateurs peuvent gérer efficacement les versions de leurs projets LaTeX et collaborer en toute simplicité. Cette configuration permet de pousser les modifications d’Overleaf vers GitHub et de récupérer les mises à jour de GitHub dans Overleaf. Elle garantit que les révisions des documents sont suivies, réduisant ainsi le risque d’erreurs dans un environnement collaboratif. Suivez ce guide pour apprendre à connecter Overleaf à GitHub et gérer vos documents LaTeX de manière efficace.

\section{Conflict provocation}
Conflicts may arise when working with colleagues on one common project. The following section contains five paragraphs, which the participants will be asked to change simultaneously in order to provoke conflicts!

\subsection{Conflict 1}
Macroeconomic Forecasting is an awesome and beautiful discipline that helps us understand resource allocation and market operations. The IWH has significantly contributed through studies on the economic effects of structural change in Eastern Germany, offering valuable insights for similar areas.
We need to set parameters and develop models.
Next is necessary.


\subsection{Conflict 2}
Economics informs public policy by analyzing data and developing models. IWH researchers have influenced policy debates on labor market reforms and fiscal federalism, but unfortunately nobody is really listening.

\subsection{Conflict 3}
Addressing global challenges like poverty and climate change, economics offers evidence-based recommendations. The IWH's research on climate change economics emphasizes the benefits of sustainable development and the need for international cooperation.
I am the first pusher

\subsection{Conflict 4}
Economics is interdisciplinary, incorporating insights from psychology and sociology to understand human behavior. The IWH fosters collaboration between economists and other experts, leading to innovative research on social networks and cultural factors.

\subsection{Conflict 5}
As a field that is exposed to technological change, economics continually evolves to address new challenges. The IWH pioneers research on the digital economy and technological change, providing insights into taking advantage of digitalization benefits while mitigating risks.
